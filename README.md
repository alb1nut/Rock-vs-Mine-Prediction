# Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction
This project implements a Logistic Regression model to distinguish between rock and metal (mine) reflections using sonar signal data. The model is trained on the Sonar, Mines vs. Rocks Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

# üîç Problem Statement
Input: 60 numerical features representing sonar signal frequencies.
Output: Binary classification (Rock or Mine).
Goal: Build a model that accurately predicts whether a sonar signal reflection is from a rock or a metal mine.


# üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Python (Primary language)
Scikit-learn (Machine Learning: Logistic Regression)
Pandas & NumPy (Data Processing)
